## Blog example code

### This is the "blog" web app created from the "Learning Flask Framework" by Matt Copperwaite & Charles Leifer book

Note: this code is not downloaded from the example code provided from the book. It was coded along while I was reading the book. 
Some of the code are different due to the changes from Flask and related extesions packages.

The book was well written. I really like it.
